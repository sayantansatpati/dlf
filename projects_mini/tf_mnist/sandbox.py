    Initializing the weights with random numbers from a normal distribution is good practice.
    Randomizing the weights helps the model from becoming stuck in the same place every time you train it.
    You'll learn more about this in the next lesson, when you study gradient descent.

    Similarly, choosing weights from a normal distribution prevents any one weight from overwhelming other weights.
    You'll use the tf.truncated_normal() function to generate random numbers from a normal distribution.

    The tf.truncated_normal() function returns a tensor with random values from a normal distribution whose magnitude
    is no more than 2 standard deviations from the mean

    Let's use the simplest solution, setting the bias to 0.
